1
00:00:56,812 --> 00:01:00,851
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- It's a great idea. Now, come on.

2
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:10,206
- Do you go to school here?
- I used to.

3
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:12,726
On top of the gym it's so cool.

4
00:01:12,812 --> 00:01:14,803
You can see the whole town.

5
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:20,124
don't want to go up there.

6
00:01:20,212 --> 00:01:22,442
Oh, you can't wait, huh?

7
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:24,648
We're just gonna get in trouble.

8
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:27,962
Yeah, you can count on it.

9
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:35,723
- What was that?
- What was what?

10
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:39,202
- I heard a noise.
- It's nothing.

11
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:41,965
Uh... maybe it's something.

12
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:45,522
- Well, maybe it's some thing.
- It's not funny.

13
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:50,323
Hello?

14
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:55,843
There's nobody here.

15
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:00,524
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

16
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:04,046
OK.

17
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:49,249
Buffy?

18
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,242
- I'm up, Mom.
- Don't wanna be late for your first day.

19
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:58,200
No. Wouldn't want that.

20
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:25,244
Have a good time. I know you're gonna
make friends right away. Just think positive.

21
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:27,842
And honey?

22
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:33,009
- Try not to get kicked out.
- I promise.

23
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:34,081
OK.

24
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:44,684
Excuse me. Coming through.
Pardon me. Excuse me. Whoa!

25
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:47,882
Excuse me. An accident. Stop!

26
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:50,042
Please move. Whoa! Excuse me.

27
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:57,608
Oh, God! OK, I feel good.

28
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:02,211
Willow! You're so very much
the person I wanted to see.

29
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:05,807
- Really?
- Yeah. I kinda had a problem with the math.

30
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:08,804
- Uh, which part?
- The math. Can you help me out tonight?

31
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,723
Please be my study buddy.

32
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,645
- Well, what's in it for me?
- A shiny nickel.

33
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:17,042
OK. Do you have "Theories in Trig"?
You should check it out.

34
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:18,326
Check it out?

35
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:23,042
- From the library. Where the books live.
- I'm there. See? I wanna change.

36
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:25,362
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, Jesse! What's what?

37
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:27,807
- New girl!
- That's right. I saw her.

38
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:30,929
- Pretty much a hottie.
- I heard someone was transferring.

39
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:32,843
- So, tell.
- Tell what?

40
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,366
What's the sitch?
What do you know about her?

41
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:39,001
- New girl.
- Well, you're certainly a font of nothing.

42
00:05:39,652 --> 00:05:44,487
Buffy Summers. Sophomore.
Late of Hemery High in Los Angeles.

43
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:48,281
Interesting record. Quite a career.

44
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:59,890
Welcome to Sunnydale. A clean slate, Buffy.
That's what you get here. What's past is past.

45
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:04,762
We're not interested in what it says
on a piece of paper. Even if it says...

46
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,360
- Mr Flutie...
- Kids here are free to call me Bob.

47
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:12,443
- Bob...
- But they don't.

48
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:15,684
I know my transcripts are a little colourful.

49
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:22,006
We're not caring about that.
Do you think, uh, colourful is the word?

50
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:23,844
Not, uh... dismal?

51
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:26,685
- It wasn't that bad.
- You burned down the gym.

52
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:30,841
I did. I really did, but...
you're not seeing the big picture here.

53
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,207
I mean, that gym was full of vampi...

54
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:36,087
Asbestos.

55
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:38,128
Buffy. Don't worry.

56
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:43,809
Any other school, they might say "Watch
your step," or "We'll be watching you."

57
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:46,531
But that's just not the way here.

58
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:52,008
We want to service your needs
and help you to respect our needs.

59
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:56,051
And if your needs
and our needs don't mesh...

60
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:10,242
Ooh! Oh, sorry! It's... OK.

61
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:16,002
Can I have you?

62
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:18,208
Duh! Can I help you?

63
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:21,926
- Thanks.
- I don't know you, do I?

64
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:25,210
- I'm Buffy. I'm new.
- Xander...

65
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:27,328
..is... is me. Hi.

66
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,084
Oh, thanks!

67
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:31,845
Well, um, maybe I'll see you around.

68
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:33,968
Maybe at school, since we

69
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:36,930
both go there.

70
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:38,960
Great!

71
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:41,043
It was nice to meet you.

72
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:46,925
"We both go to school." Very suave.

73
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:49,765
Very not pathetic. Oh! Hey!

74
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:54,242
Hey! You forgot your stake.

75
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:06,052
It's estimated that about 25 million people
died in that one four-year span.

76
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:11,252
But the fun part of the Black Plague
is that it originated in Europe... how?

77
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:15,523
As an early form of germ warfare.

78
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:21,208
If you'll look at the map on page 63,
you can trace the spread of the disease

79
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,329
- Into Rome and then north
- Thanks.

80
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:29,691
And this popular plague
led to what social changes? Steve?

81
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:37,206
- Hi, I'm Cordelia.
- I'm Buffy.

82
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:41,527
If you're looking for your own textbook,
there's a few in the library.

83
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:45,207
- Great. Thanks. Where would that be?
- I'll show you. Come on.

84
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,965
- So, you're from Hemery, right? In LA?
- Yeah.

85
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:52,443
Oh, I would kill to live in LA.
That close to that many shoes!

86
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:59,163
You'll be OK here. If you hang with me
and mine, you'll be accepted in no time.

87
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:02,244
Of course,
we do have to test your coolness factor.

88
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:05,927
You're from LA,
so you can skip the written, but, let's see...

89
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,968
Vamp nail polish?

90
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:09,929
Um... over?

91
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:12,606
So over. James Spader?

92
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:14,648
He needs to call me!

93
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:17,292
- Frappuchinos?
- Trendy but tasty.

94
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,283
- John Tesh?
- The Devil.

95
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,727
That was pretty much a gimme,
but you passed!

96
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,848
Oh, goody!

97
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:25,160
Willow!

98
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:29,768
Nice dress! Good to know
you've seen the softer side of Sears.

99
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:32,408
Oh, well, my mom picked it out.

100
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:35,484
No wonder you're
such a guy-magnet. Are you done?

101
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:44,082
If you wanna fit in here,
the first rule is "know your losers".

102
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:48,085
Once you can identify them all by sight,
they're a lot easier to avoid.

103
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:58,811
If you're not swamped with catching up,
come by the Bronze tonight.

104
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:02,362
- The who?
- The Bronze. The only club worth going to.

105
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:06,286
They let anybody in, but it's still the scene.
It's in the bad part of town.

106
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,284
- Where's that?
- Half a block from the good part.

107
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:12,523
We don't have a whole lot of town here.
But you should show.

108
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,682
Well, I'll try. Uh, thanks.

109
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:16,922
Good. So, um, I'll see you at gym,

110
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:20,482
and you can tell me
everything there is to know about you.

111
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:22,051
Great!

112
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,248
Oh, that sounds like fun!

113
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:32,721
Hello?

114
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:41,441
Is anybody here?

115
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:53,246
- Oh! Anybody's here.
- Can I help you?

116
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:58,210
I was looking for some, well, books. I'm new.

117
00:10:58,812 --> 00:10:59,847
Miss Summers?

118
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:03,963
Good call. I guess I'm the only new kid, huh?

119
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:07,362
I'm Mr Giles. The librarian.

120
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:09,443
I was told you were coming.

121
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:13,607
Great. So, um, I'm gonna need
"Perspectives on 20th-Century..."

122
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:15,922
I know what you're after.

123
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:22,681
That's not what I'm looking for.

124
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:26,525
- Are you sure?
- I'm way sure.

125
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:30,408
My mistake.

126
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,850
So, what is it you said?

127
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:43,125
The new kid? She seems weird to me.
And what kind of name is Buffy?

128
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:44,565
- Hey, Aphrodisia.
- Hey!

129
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:49,168
The chatter in the caff is she got kicked out
and that's why her mom had to get a new job.

130
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:52,050
- Neg.
- Pos. She was starting fights!

131
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:55,647
- Neg-ly!
- Well, I heard it from Blue, and she said...

132
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:12,086
Uh, hi.

133
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:13,810
- Willow, right?
- Why?

134
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:16,804
I mean, hi.
Did you want me to move?

135
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:19,042
Why don't we start with "Hi, I'm Buffy"?

136
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:22,807
And then let's segue
directly into me asking you for a favour.

137
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,929
It involves hanging out with me for a while.

138
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,606
But aren't you hanging out with Cordelia?

139
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:31,490
- I can't do both?
- Not legally.

140
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:35,250
Look, I really wanna get by here.
New school and...

141
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:38,165
Cordelia's been really nice to me, anyway.

142
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:42,450
But, I have this burning desire
not to flunk all my classes and

143
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:46,889
- I heard you're the one to help me catch up.
- I could totally help you out!

144
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:50,009
If you have sixth period free,
we could meet in the library.

145
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:51,650
Or not.

146
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:55,964
We could meet someplace quieter.
Louder. That place gives me the wiggins.

147
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,681
It has that effect on most kids. But I love it.

148
00:12:58,772 --> 00:13:02,048
It's a great collection.
The new librarian is really cool.

149
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:04,282
- He's new?
- Yeah, he just started.

150
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:08,843
He was a curator at some British museum.
Or The British Museum. I'm not sure.

151
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:12,368
He knows everything.
He brought all these historical volumes

152
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:15,808
- And am I the single dullest person alive?
- Not at all.

153
00:13:15,892 --> 00:13:18,008
You guys busy? Are we interrupting?

154
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:19,047
Hey.

155
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,724
- Hey.
- Hey, there.

156
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:23,042
This is Jesse, and that's Xander.

157
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:26,090
Me and Buffy go way back.
Old friends. Very close.

158
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,687
Then there was our estrangement
where we both grew as people,

159
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:34,084
but now here we are like old times.
I'm quite moved.

160
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:37,164
Is it me,
or are you turning into a bibbling idiot?

161
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,291
No. It's, uh, it's not you.

162
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:43,011
Well, it's nice to meet you guys. I think.

163
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:45,811
We wanted to welcome you,
make you feel at home.

164
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,725
- Unless you have a scary home.
- And to return this.

165
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:52,566
The only thing I could think is that
you're building a really little fence.

166
00:13:53,092 --> 00:13:57,882
Uh... no, um... Actually, it was for
self-defence. Everyone has them in LA.

167
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:59,963
Pepper spray is just so passé.

168
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:03,644
What do you do for fun?
What do you look for in a man?

169
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:06,530
If you have any dark secrets
you'd like us to publish...

170
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:10,323
Gee, everyone wants to know about me.
How keen.

171
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:14,405
Not much goes on in a town like Sunnydale.
You're pretty big news.

172
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:16,767
I'm not. Really.

173
00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:19,924
- Are these guys bothering you?
- Uh, no!

174
00:14:20,012 --> 00:14:22,048
She's not hanging out with us.

175
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:24,362
- Hey, Cordelia.
- Oh, please.

176
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:29,048
Sorry to interrupt your downward mobility,
but you won't be meeting Coach Foster,

177
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:30,929
the woman with the chest hair,

178
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:34,766
because gym was cancelled
due to the extreme dead guy in the locker.

179
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:36,843
- What?
- What are you talking about?

180
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:38,968
Some guy was stuffed in Aura's locker.

181
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,202
- Dead?
- Totally dead. Way dead.

182
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:44,170
- Notjust a little dead?
- Don't you have an elsewhere to be?

183
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:47,449
If you need a shoulder to cry on,
or just to nibble on...

184
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:50,126
- How did he die?
- I don't know.

185
00:14:50,212 --> 00:14:54,205
- Well, were there any marks?
- Morbid much! I didn't ask!

186
00:14:56,612 --> 00:15:00,241
I gotta book. I'II... I'll see you guys later.

187
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:04,443
What's her deal?

188
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,842
Oh, great!

189
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:36,361
- OK, what's the sitch?
- Sorry?

190
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:39,330
You heard about the dead guy, right?
In the locker?

191
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:42,245
- Yes.
- Cos it's the weirdest thing.

192
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:46,965
He's got two little holes in his neck
and all his blood's been drained.

193
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:50,203
Isn't that bizarre?
Aren't you just going "Oooh..."?

194
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:54,210
- I was afraid of this.
- Well, I wasn't.

195
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:58,490
It's my first day. I was afraid that
I was gonna be behind in all my classes,

196
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:02,485
that I wouldn't make any friends,
that I would have last month's hair.

197
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:06,326
I didn't think there'd be vampires on campus.
And I don't care.

198
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:09,165
Then why are you here?

199
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:12,130
To tell you that I don't care,

200
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:15,921
which I don't, and... have now told you.

201
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:18,128
So... bye.

202
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:20,646
Is he... will he rise again?

203
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:23,283
- Who?
- The boy.

204
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:27,203
- No. He's just dead.
- Can you be sure?

205
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:31,046
To make you a vampire, they suck your blood
and then you suck their blood.

206
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:34,966
It's like a whole big sucking thing.
Mostly, they're just gonna kill you.

207
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:39,045
- Why am I still talking to you?
- You have no idea what's going on, do you?

208
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:42,044
You think it's coincidence, your being here?

209
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:44,642
Why can't you people just leave me alone?

210
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:49,203
Because you are the Slayer.
"Into each generation, a slayer is born."

211
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:52,887
"One girl, in all the world, a Chosen One.
One born with the strength

212
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:57,887
and skill to hunt the vampires. To stop
the spread of evil." I've heard it, OK?

213
00:16:57,972 --> 00:17:02,409
I don't understand this attitude. You've
accepted your duty, slain vampires before.

214
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:05,370
I've been there and done that,
and I'm moving on.

215
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:09,367
What do you know about this town?

216
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:12,012
It's two hours on the freeway
from Neiman Marcus?

217
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:16,688
Dig a bit in the history of this place and
you find a stream of fairly odd occurrences.

218
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:19,445
This whole area
is a centre of mystical energy.

219
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:23,002
Things gravitate towards it
that you might not find elsewhere.

220
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:27,688
- Like vampires.
- Like zombies. Werewolves. Incubi. Succubi.

221
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:33,130
Everything you dreaded was under your bed
but told yourself couldn't be. They're all real.

222
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:35,646
What?
You sent away for the Time-Life Series?

223
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:37,563
Um... yes.

224
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:40,325
- Did you get the free phone?
- The calendar.

225
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:47,131
Cool! But... OK, first of all, I'm a vampire
slayer. And secondly, I'm retired.

226
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:51,364
- Hey, I know! Why don't you kill 'em?
- I'm a watcher. I haven't the skill.

227
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:55,206
Oh, come on! A stake through the heart...
it's like falling off a log.

228
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:57,965
- A slayer slays. A watcher...
- Watches?

229
00:17:58,052 --> 00:18:03,206
Yes. No! He trains her.
He prepares her.

230
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:08,844
Prepares me for what? For getting kicked out
of school? For losing all of my friends?

231
00:18:08,932 --> 00:18:11,321
For spending my time fighting for my life

232
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:15,530
and never getting to tell anyone
because I might endanger them? Go ahead.

233
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:18,044
Prepare me.

234
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:28,007
Damn!

235
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:34,171
What?

236
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:37,730
- It's getting worse.
- What's getting worse?

237
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:43,246
The influx of the undead.
It's been building for years.

238
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,527
There's a reason why you're here now.

239
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:48,285
Because now is the time
my mom moved here.

240
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:53,207
Something is coming. Something...
Something is... gonna happen here. Soon.

241
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,362
Gee, can you vague that up for me?

242
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:59,843
The signs, as far as I can tell, point
to a crucial mystical upheaval very soon.

243
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,763
Days, possibly less.

244
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:06,403
Oh, come on! This is Sunnydale.
How bad an evil can there be here?

245
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:39,046
The sleeper will wake.

246
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:45,046
The sleeper will wake.

247
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:52,806
The sleeper will wake.

248
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:59,766
The sleeper will wake.

249
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:02,766
And the world will bleed.

250
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:08,727
Amen!

251
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:16,840
Hi! I'm an enormous slut!

252
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:20,648
Hello. Would you like a copy
of "The Watchtower"?

253
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:23,243
I used to be so good at this.

254
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:25,323
- Hi, hon.
- Hey!

255
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:29,010
- Are you going out tonight?
- Yeah. I'm going to a club.

256
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:33,405
- Oh. Will there be boys there?
- No, Mom. It's a nun club!

257
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:36,531
- Well, just be careful.
- I will.

258
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:44,684
You know, I think we can make it work here.
I've got my positive energy flowing.

259
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:47,206
I'm gonna get the gallery on its feet.

260
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,886
- We may have found a space today.
- That's great.

261
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:54,090
That school is a very nurturing environment,
which is what you need.

262
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:57,005
- Well, actually...
- Oh, not too nurturing.

263
00:20:57,092 --> 00:21:01,768
I know. You're 16. I've read all about
the dangers of over-nurturing.

264
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:08,606
It's hard. New town and everything.
It is for me, too.

265
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:15,288
I'm trying to make it work.
I'm going to make it work.

266
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:17,567
- I know.
- You're a good girl, Buffy.

267
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:22,203
You just fell in with the wrong crowd.
But that is all behind us now.

268
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:26,126
It is. From now on,
I am only going to hang out with the living.

269
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:29,045
I mean lively... people.

270
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:30,841
OK.

271
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:32,923
You have fun.

272
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:59,044
- Is there a problem, ma'am?
- Yeah, there's a problem.

273
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:00,963
Why are you following me?

274
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:05,887
I know what you're thinking, but don't worry.
I don't bite.

275
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:21,046
The truth is, I thought you'd be taller.
Or bigger muscles and all that.

276
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:23,723
You're pretty spry, though.

277
00:23:23,812 --> 00:23:26,770
- What do you want?
- The same thing you do.

278
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:29,807
OK... What do I want?

279
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:34,324
To kill 'em. To kill 'em all.

280
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:38,121
Incorrect, but you do get this watch
and a year's supply of Turtle Wax.

281
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:42,967
- What I want is to be left alone!
- Do you think that's an option any more?

282
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:46,283
You're standing at the mouth of Hell.

283
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,363
And it's about to open.

284
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:52,683
Don't turn your back on this.

285
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:58,444
- You've gotta be ready.
- What for?

286
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:00,611
For the Harvest.

287
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:04,769
Who are you?

288
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:07,764
Let's just say... I'm a friend.

289
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:12,846
Yeah, well, maybe I don't want a friend.

290
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:16,042
I didn't say I was yours.

291
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,124
What's up?

292
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,441
Hey.

293
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:37,770
- Hey!
- Oh, hi!

294
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:39,611
Hi!

295
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:43,128
- Are you here with someone?
- No. I'm just here.

296
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:47,125
- I thought Xander was gonna show up.
- Oh! Are you guys going out?

297
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:51,205
No, we're just friends.
We used to go out, but we broke up.

298
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:54,809
- How come?
- He stole my Barbie.

299
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:57,405
Oh, we were five.

300
00:25:59,612 --> 00:26:03,400
- I don't actually date a whole lot... lately.
- Why not?

301
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,043
Well, when I'm with a boy I like,

302
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:11,330
it's hard for me to say anything cool,
or... or witty, or at all.

303
00:26:11,412 --> 00:26:14,768
I can usually make a few vowel sounds,
and then I have to go away.

304
00:26:15,132 --> 00:26:17,566
- It's not that bad.
- No, it is.

305
00:26:17,972 --> 00:26:21,169
I thinks boys are more interested
in a girl who can talk.

306
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:26,042
- You really haven't been dating lately.
- It's probably easy for you.

307
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:28,809
Yeah. Real easy.

308
00:26:28,892 --> 00:26:31,008
I mean, you don't seem too shy.

309
00:26:31,972 --> 00:26:34,566
Well, my philosophy...
Do you want to hear it?

310
00:26:34,652 --> 00:26:36,882
- Yeah, I do.
- Life is short.

311
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:41,480
- "Life is short."
- Not original, I'll grant you, but it's true.

312
00:26:41,572 --> 00:26:45,360
Why waste time being shy and worrying
about some guy laughing at you?

313
00:26:45,452 --> 00:26:48,330
Seize the moment,
cos tomorrow you might be dead.

314
00:26:49,372 --> 00:26:51,090
Oh, that's nice!

315
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,563
Um, I'll be back in a minute.

316
00:26:56,652 --> 00:26:59,724
Oh, that's... that's OK.
You don't have to come back.

317
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:01,803
I'll be back in a minute.

318
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:05,648
"Seize the moment."

319
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:26,970
Like partying with students?
Ain't that skanky?

320
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:29,327
Oh, right! This is me having fun.

321
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:32,882
Watching "clown hair" prance about
is hardly my idea of a party.

322
00:27:32,972 --> 00:27:36,009
I'd rather be at home
with a cup of Bovril and a good book.

323
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:37,605
You need a personality.

324
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:41,810
This is a perfect breeding ground
for vampires. It's dark, crowded...

325
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:45,009
I knew you would show up.
I have to make you understand.

326
00:27:45,092 --> 00:27:47,890
That the Harvest is coming.
I know. Your friend told me.

327
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:49,849
- What did you say?
- The Harvest.

328
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:52,844
Does that mean something to you?
Cos I'm drawing a blank.

329
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:55,924
I'm not sure. Who told you this?

330
00:27:56,692 --> 00:28:02,403
This guy. Dark, gorgeous in an annoying
sort of way. I figured you two were buds.

331
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,445
No.

332
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:07,772
The Harvest... Did he say anything else?

333
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:12,243
Something about the "mouth of Hell".
I really didn't like him.

334
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:27,651
Look at them. Throwing themselves about.
Unaware of the danger that surrounds them.

335
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:30,166
- Lucky them.
- Or perhaps you're right.

336
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:33,722
Perhaps there is no trouble coming.
The signs could be wrong.

337
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:37,043
It's not as though
you've been having the nightmares.

338
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:45,167
Mom doesn't get out of bed.
The doctor says it's Epstein-Barr.

339
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:49,962
I'm, like, "It's chronic hepatitis
or at least chronic fatigue syndrome."

340
00:28:50,052 --> 00:28:53,010
I mean, nobody cool
has Epstein-Barr any more.

341
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:57,051
- Hey, Cordelia!
- Oh, yea, it's my stalker!

342
00:28:57,772 --> 00:29:01,401
- You look... you look great.
- I'm glad we had this little chat.

343
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:04,882
Listen, you know, wanna dance? You know?

344
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:07,042
- With you?
- Well, uh, yeah.

345
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:09,123
Well, uh, no!

346
00:29:09,212 --> 00:29:10,281
Come on, guys.

347
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,401
Fine.

348
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,483
Plenty other fish in the sea.

349
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:21,250
Oh, yeah, I'm... on the prowl!

350
00:29:21,652 --> 00:29:24,041
Witness me prowling!

351
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:30,291
I didn't say I'd never slay another vampire.

352
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:32,966
I don't have fluffy bunny feelings for them.

353
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:36,681
I'm just not gonna get extracurricular with it.
If I see one, sure...

354
00:29:36,772 --> 00:29:38,285
Will you be ready?

355
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:42,047
There's so much you don't know about them,
about your own powers.

356
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:45,169
A vampire appears to be normal
until the feed is upon them.

357
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:48,130
Only then do they reveal
their true demonic visage.

358
00:29:48,212 --> 00:29:50,601
You're like a textbook with arms. I know this.

359
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:54,002
The point is,
a slayer should be able to see them anyway.

360
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,765
Without looking, without thinking.

361
00:29:57,572 --> 00:30:00,450
Can you tell me
if there's a vampire in this building?

362
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,523
- Maybe.
- You should know.

363
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:05,570
Even through this mass and this din,

364
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:07,643
you should be able to sense them.

365
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:09,481
Well, try.

366
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:12,484
Reach out with your mind. Hone your senses.

367
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:16,804
Focus until the energy washes over you,
until you feel every particle of...

368
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:18,928
- There's one.
- Wh-where?

369
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:21,082
Right there. Talking to that girl.

370
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:23,725
- You don't know...
- Oh, please!

371
00:30:23,812 --> 00:30:26,531
Look at his jacket.
He's got the sleeves rolled up.

372
00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:29,365
And the shirt?
Deal with that outfit for a moment.

373
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,886
- It's dated?
- It's carbon dated.

374
00:30:31,972 --> 00:30:36,124
Trust me. Only someone living underground
would think that was still the look.

375
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:37,964
But you didn't... hone.

376
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:43,126
Oh, no!

377
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:46,928
- Isn't that...?
- Willow.

378
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,129
- What's she doing?
- Seizing the moment.

379
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:53,091
Cordelia!

380
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,051
God! What is your childhood trauma?!

381
00:31:57,772 --> 00:32:00,491
Have you guys seen Willow?
Did she come by here?

382
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:02,927
Do you need to attack her with the stick?

383
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:05,411
Jeez!

384
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:11,402
Excuse me. I have to call everyone
I have ever met, right now.

385
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:18,089
That was quick. Well done.
I need to go to the library.

386
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:21,209
- This Harvest thing...
- I didn't find them.

387
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:25,570
- The vampire is not dead?
- No, but my social life is on the critical list.

388
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,007
- So, what do we do?
- I'll take care of it.

389
00:32:28,092 --> 00:32:32,244
- I need to come with you, yes?
- Don't worry. One vampire I can handle.

390
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:35,491
So, um, what did you say your name was?

391
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:40,770
- Darla.
- Darla. I haven't seen you around before.

392
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:45,164
- Are you from around here?
- No, but I have family here.

393
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:50,165
- Have I met them?
- You probably will.

394
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:29,240
Master.

395
00:33:33,852 --> 00:33:39,290
- I am weak.
- Come the Harvest, you will be restored.

396
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:41,363
The Harvest.

397
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,728
We're almost there.

398
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:45,803
Soon you will be free.

399
00:33:57,252 --> 00:34:00,085
I must be ready. I need my strength.

400
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:03,881
- I've sent your servants to bring you food.
- Good.

401
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:05,691
- Luke?
- Yes?

402
00:34:05,772 --> 00:34:08,240
Bring me something young.

403
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:12,363
Sure is dark.

404
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:15,489
- It's night.
- Well, that's a dark time. Night.

405
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:19,451
Traditionally. I still can't believe
I've never seen you at school.

406
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:22,046
Do you have Mr Chomsky for history?

407
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:28,364
The ice-cream bar is this way.
It's past Hamilton Street.

408
00:34:28,452 --> 00:34:30,443
I know a shortcut.

409
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:45,730
- Leaving already?
- Xander. Have you seen Willow?

410
00:34:45,812 --> 00:34:48,929
- Not tonight, no.
- She left with a guy.

411
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:52,448
We're talking about Willow?
Scoring at the Bronze! Work it, girl!

412
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:55,410
No, I need to find her.
Where would he take her?

413
00:34:55,492 --> 00:35:00,646
Why? Oh, hey, I hope he's not a vampire,
because then you might have to slay him.

414
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:06,729
Was there a school bulletin?
Was it in the newspaper?

415
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:10,088
Is there anyone in this town
who doesn't know I'm the Slayer?

416
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:13,323
I know you think you're the Slayer,
and the reason why...

417
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:16,961
Whatever. It doesn't matter.
Just tell me - Where would Willow go?

418
00:35:17,052 --> 00:35:18,883
You're serious.

419
00:35:18,972 --> 00:35:22,567
We don't find her, and there's gonna be
one more dead body in the morning.

420
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:26,606
OK, this... this is nice... and scary.

421
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:29,331
Are you sure this is faster?

422
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:32,210
Hey, you ever been in one of these?

423
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:33,566
No...

424
00:35:33,652 --> 00:35:35,051
Thank you.

425
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:37,890
Come on.

426
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,883
What are you afraid of?

427
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,241
That wasn't funny.

428
00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:09,761
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Is that what you think?

429
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:19,206
- Is this the best you could do?
- She's fresh.

430
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:21,283
Hardly enough to share.

431
00:36:22,452 --> 00:36:24,443
Why didn't you bring your own?

432
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:26,810
- I did.
- Hey!

433
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:28,291
Wait up!

434
00:36:30,492 --> 00:36:31,766
Oh, my God! Jesse!

435
00:36:37,132 --> 00:36:39,600
You know, you gave me a hickey.

436
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:44,569
- I got hungry on the way.
- Oh, Jesse, let's get outta here!

437
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:47,450
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

438
00:36:48,692 --> 00:36:50,523
Leave us alone!

439
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:54,048
You're not going anywhere until we've fed!

440
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:58,283
Well, this is nice.

441
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:02,244
It's a little bare, but a dash of paint,

442
00:37:02,332 --> 00:37:04,800
a few throw pillows... call it home!

443
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:06,405
Who the hell are you?

444
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:09,768
There's someone in this town
who doesn't know already?

445
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:14,004
That's a relief. Having a secret identity
in this town is ajob of work.

446
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:16,845
- Buffy, we bail now, right?
- Not yet.

447
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:22,529
OK, first of all, what's with the outfit?
Live in the now, OK? You look like DeBarge.

448
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:29,723
Now, we can do this the hard way,
or Well, actually, there's just the hard way.

449
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:33,407
- That's fine with me.
- Are you sure? This is not gonna be pretty.

450
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:36,768
We're talking violence,
strong language, adult content...

451
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:53,808
- See what happens when you roughhouse?
- He was young and stupid.

452
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:55,883
- Xander, go!
- Don't go far.

453
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:12,927
You know, I just wanted to start over.
Be like everybody else.

454
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:16,971
Have some friends, you know, maybe a dog.
But no. You had to come here.

455
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:20,283
- You couldn't go suck on some other town.
- Who are you?

456
00:38:20,852 --> 00:38:22,649
Don't you know?

457
00:38:24,692 --> 00:38:26,683
I don't care.

458
00:38:30,652 --> 00:38:33,564
You were supposed to bring
an offering for the Master.

459
00:38:33,652 --> 00:38:36,644
We're almost at Harvest
and you dally with this child.

460
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,962
We had someone. But then she came.

461
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:42,249
She killed Thomas. Luke she's strong.

462
00:38:42,772 --> 00:38:44,171
You go.

463
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:46,720
I'll see if I can handle the little girl.

464
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:59,084
You're strong.

465
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:04,043
I'm stronger.

466
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:08,443
We'll get the police! It's just a few blocks up!

467
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:18,401
- You're wasting my time.
- Hey! I had other plans, too, OK?

468
00:39:26,892 --> 00:39:30,009
You think you can stop me? Stop us?

469
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:37,370
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

470
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:47,803
"And like a plague of boils,
the race of Man covered the Earth."

471
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:53,162
"But on the third day of the newest light
will come the Harvest

472
00:39:53,252 --> 00:39:56,528
and the blood of men will flow as wine

473
00:39:57,092 --> 00:40:00,721
when the Master
will walk among them once more."

474
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:05,807
"The Earth will belong to the Old Ones."

475
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:12,170
"And Hell itself will come to town."

476
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:40,563
Amen.

477
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:50,560
